# PremiumCalculationService

##How to build
Please make PremiumCalculationService.Functions project as the "startup project" and run. This should build the solution and open Azure CLI simulator, in which the exposed functions and their URL will be displayed. Azure functions has been configured to run locally on localhost:7071. The function URLS as are follow

###GetOccupations: this function returns the list of occupations.
http://localhost:7071/api/GetOccupations

###GetMonthlyPremium: this calculates the montly premium and retuns a MonthlyPremium object.
http://localhost:7071/api/GetMonthlyPremium?coverAmount=1&occupationId=1&age=1

##Design:
This service is an Azure Functions project. For abstraction within Functions and Application layer it used Command Query Repository Pattern (CQRS). The most important intention behind using CQRS here is to abstract query/command handling from invocation and to keep the function layer clean.

It uses Domain Driven Design's onion architecture (Anaemic domain).
The entities that I could identify are as follow -
  - Occupation
  - Rating and
  - OccupationRating
  
It uses IOccupationRepository, IRatingRepository and IOccupationRatingRepository for seeding data. In order to connect with database, the only change that needs to be done is in these repositories. For the purpose of this demonstration, this service uses local data (hard-coded).

Arrangements of projects is as follows -

1) Domain: the inner most layer (standalone)
1) Common: common project for AutoFac wild card implementation.
2) Application: This project comprises of the business logic ie. Queries and Commands. Its depends on Domain layer.
  - Each query in this layer has it's own model classes defined.
3) Application.Tests: From the perspective of structure, this project is a mirror of Application project. It has unit test classes for queries in the Application project.
4) Functions: this is the outmost layer and exposes the required functions.

###Validation
For service validation FluentValidation is used. The GetMonthlyPremium function has a validator (GetMonthlyPremiumQueryValidator) configured to validate the mandatory fields.
Class GetMonthlyPremiumQueryValidatorTests has the unit test cases to test GetMonthlyPremiumQueryValidator.

##Assumptions
1) This service is not connected to database. It returns hardcoded results (except montly premium calculation).
